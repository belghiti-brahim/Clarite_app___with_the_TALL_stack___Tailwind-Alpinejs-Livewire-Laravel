### A personal organizational tool.
The app is inspired by the GTD method and it is structured around this simple clear workflow : A person has responsibilities(roles), as one of this roles he initiat projects that he complete by do actions.

the app could work as tool to organize all your engagements, responsibilities, projects. 
Or just like a simple todo app where you write actions and you cross them off once they're complete.
